# Python for Data Science
Python for Data Science is a study guide with the necessary step-by-step to learn about one of the most in-demand professional fields in recent years. Each stage of this process has been carefully thought out by Alura team, ensuring that, by the end of the training, I will have developed skills to tackle various challenges in the field of Data Science.


## Why I decided to study Python? 
Python was my first language, and my first contact with it was in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. One of my teachers suggested that I take on a new challenge, and it was love at first sight. However, there have been several months since I last got hands-on with Python and other technologies like Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and Numpy. Therefore, I have decided to review and revisit them!

## What I will study in this study guide?
In this course, I will familiarize myself with Python a little bit more, my favorite language in Data Science, by studying the most widely used libraries, including Pandas and Numpy. In the end, I hope to learn about data collection, preparation, and exploration using Pandas in projects covering a variety of subjects.
