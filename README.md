# Alura Courses 
This repository is dedicated to sharing my studies in various technologies through the Alura platform. 
## What is Alura? 
[Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/) is the largest Brazilian ecosystem for studying technologies, offering a wide range of content, including:
- Programming languages
- Web development
- Data science
- Artificial intelligence
- Mobile development
- DevOps
- UX & Design 
- Innovation & Management 

The platform provides pathways to study any technology. As my studies progress, I will regularly update this readme file with a brief summary of what is new. Additionally, I will create another folder with a more detailed readme, providing comprehensive information about the content.
